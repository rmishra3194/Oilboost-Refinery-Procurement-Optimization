# Oilboost-Refinery-Procurement-Optimization
This project models the procurement and production optimization problem for the Oilboost Refinery. It calculates the optimal daily procurement plan from different crude sources (Kuwait, Venezuela, and Qatar) to meet demands for gasoline, jet fuel, and lubricants.

Key Features:

Formulates a linear programming (LP) model for procurement optimization.

Uses Excel Solver to find the minimum-cost procurement plan.

Explores scenarios including the introduction of a new crude supplier (Qatar).

Comprehensive report with step-by-step analysis, feasibility checks, and business insights.

Highlights:

Finds the cheapest procurement plan to meet demand.

Analyzes yield and cost trade-offs across different crude sources.

Identifies the maximum price Qatar can charge without being excluded from the procurement mix.

Technologies Used:

Excel Solver
